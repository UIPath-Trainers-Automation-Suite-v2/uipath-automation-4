UiPath Trainers Automation Suite v2 - Automation 4 : Plagarism Bot

Updated for version 2021.4.4

!IMPORTANT! Please update the Application ID and a Tenant ID in the Microsoft 365 Application scope with your own credentials from Azure Active Directory. 
You must get both after registering your desktop UiPath app in Azure Active Directory and granting the appropriate API permissions. (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-desktop-app-registration)


Microsoft 365 Update: 
The workflow documentation PDF is still accurate, though now when prompted for the CSV input file, the user has the choice to download the file from their Microsoft 365 account.

If you will choose this Microsoft 365 option, you must configure your login authentication before running the automation. 

Also note that a 365 business account is required. You may sign up for a free month, but a simple personal Microsoft account will not work.
